# Some useful scripts

This directory has some scripts I used.
You might find them useful for iterating over the [QR-paper](https://github.com/ytabatabaee/QR-paper) datasets,
computing error metrics over the datasets, and plotting.
Note that they are not very well-written though,
so make sure you know what they are doing.
